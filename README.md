This project is geared towards test-driven development. It provided a foundation, code, and prompts that helped to simulate an authentic development environment.

To write the test suites for the project, I learned about javascript testing and jasmine, and the role each plays in creating tests.

To run the application, go to jasmine/spec/index.html and open the index.html in your browser.
